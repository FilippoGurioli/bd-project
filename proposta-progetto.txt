Main Job

Objective: Analyze taxi trips across NYC boroughs over time, computing trends in trip volume, average distance, and tips.

Execution plan:

Join stage (1st shuffle):
- Join trip data with the zone lookup table to attach PU_Borough and DO_Borough names to each trip.

First aggregation (pre-aggregation):
- Group by PU_Borough and pickup_date.
- Compute num_trips, avg_distance, and avg_tip per borough per day.

Second aggregation (further aggregation / 2nd shuffle):
- Group by PU_Borough and month (or week).
- Compute average daily trips, average trip distance, and average tip per borough per month.

Optional visualizations:
- Time series of trips, distance, and tips per borough.
- Comparison of boroughs or neighborhoods.
